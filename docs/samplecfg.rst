Sample Configuration Files
==========================

The `VICTRE project <https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE>`_ made use of four configuration files to represent four breast density levels.  These configuration files can be
found in the `cfg <https://github.com/DIDSR/breastPhantom/tree/master/cfg>`_ directory of the github repository.  In the VICTRE study 50 micron voxel size was used.
For testing purposes it is advised to use the 100 micron voxel size configuration files as the factor of 8 reduction in total number of voxels reduces the phantom generation time by a similar factor.  For further details of the VICTRE trial patient population please consult `the associated paper and suplementary material <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2717000>`_

.. note:: These four configuration files do not capture the true diversity in breast anatomy and are meant to be starting points for further investigations of appropriate variations in configuration parameters
