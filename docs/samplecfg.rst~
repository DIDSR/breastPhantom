Sample Configuration Files
==========================

The `VICTRE project <https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE>`_ made use of four configuration files to represent four breast density levels.  These configuration files can be
found in the `cfg <https://github.com/DIDSR/breastPhantom/cfg>`_ directory of the github repository.
